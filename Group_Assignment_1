# Potential Research Question
The potential research question that our group (Miles Kim Parr, Max Garcia, Aydin Pasebani, Annie Chan, and Rodrigo Gutierrez) is interested in pursuing is “What is the correlation between access to parks and green space in [unincorporated LA County](https://pw.lacounty.gov/gmed/lacroads/FindUnincorporated.aspx) and community health?”   

# Why it is important
This topic is important to us because everyone, no matter where they are geographically located, should be able to live their lives in full health. There are significant disparities in parks and open space across Los Angeles County. Areas with limited park space per capita tend to exhibit higher rates of premature mortality from cardiovascular disease and diabetes, increased risk of childhood obesity, and higher chances of economic hardship ([LA County Department of Public Health](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/chronic/docs/Parks%20Report%202016-rev_051816.pdf)). There’s also stark differences in park availability for certain racial and ethnic groups, with African Americans and Latinos disproportionately impacted. With our findings, we hope to suggest recommendations to address the large inequities in park spaces across unincorporated communities in Los Angeles County. 

# Why space matters
For the spatial scope of our project, we are planning on examining unincorporated areas of LA County, each within a different Supervisorial District (District 1-5). Space matters because more than 65% of LA County is unincorporated, with a large concentration in the northern part of the County. Unincorporated areas lack local governments, which means the five-member Board of Supervisors [functions as their “city council”](https://lacounty.gov/government/about-la-county/maps-and-geography/) and each Supervisor serves all the unincorporated areas (and cities) in their respective districts. 

In our [preliminary literature review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621006249), some researchers have questioned whether counties are able to deliver adequate air and water quality services to the same extent that cities are able to. They noted that **“local government is an established structural determinant of health,”** leading us to question whether people living in unincorporated areas are more vulnerable to adverse health outcomes.

# Conclusion

We hope to gain insight into who has access to green space in unincorporated LA County. At this juncture (before we have started any analysis), our hypothesis is that access to green space will vary based on the average income of the neighborhood, in that higher-income areas will have more access to green space.
