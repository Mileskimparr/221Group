# Mini Group Assignment: Status Update
Group: Miles Kim Parr, Aydin Pasebani, Annie Chan, Max Garcia, and Rodrigo Gutierrez
## [Park Equity In Unincorporated Los Angeles](https://github.com/Mileskimparr/221Group/blob/main/Group_Assignment_1.md) 
## Roles
**Max: Statistician and Racial Equity Inspector** - In charge of looking at the role of race in the distribution of parks across our selected Supervisorial Districts. Will also be responsible for producing descriptive statistics and/or static visualizations of our data for the final project. 

**Aydin:** In charge of looking at asthma prevalence throughout LA County and making a map to contrast with distribution of parks across Supervisorial Districts. Will make maps for D5 & D2 since those are our new focus areas for this project.

**Miles: Transportation Metrics** - In charge of looking at transportation statistics including transportation need, vehicle availability and comparing it with park availability. 

**Annie:** In charge of looking at household income statistics of census tracts across Supervisorial Districts. Happy to learn to make interactive visualizations.

**Rodrigo:** In charge of looking at homelessness statistics/rates and comparing the prevalence of homelessness with the quantity of parks in an unincorporated community

## Status update
**Max:** Struggling to find enough time to get through the code with all the issues that arise (including those that occur before I am even able to start coding in a way that answers our research question).

**Aydin:** Learning by doing. Making new graphics for our two focus areas.

**Miles:** Understands most of the code that we do in class, struggling to come up with variations that produce more interesting data. 

**Annie:** I think the general mood of the team is pretty good (if I’m totally off base, please correct me.) Like Miles, I understand most of the code that we do in class. I’m able to complete assignments but usually need to use some workarounds to get there. I *just* learned how to make tooltips (which I find more interesting than popups) on the Folium maps which is pretty exciting! As for what is not working, I cannot produce pretty plotly charts of any form for the life of me.

**Rodrigo:** Refreshing my knowledge about Python, it’s been a year since i worked through Python and JupyterHub and the context I used it in was less about mapping more about social science problems, didn’t use GitHub before so learning about cloning and repositories is a process, also Folium is something new to me

## Data update
**Max:** [Countywide Parks and Open Space (Public - Hosted) | City of Los Angeles Hub](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/840b3da17e844486b3bafaae6eda87d4) 

**Rodrigo** [Homelessness data provided by Chris + Shapefile of Shelters and Services](https://www.lahsa.org/news?article=893-2022-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-data)

## Concerns

### Major concerns
**Max:** No idea how we are going to visualize all the data into only a few graphics (for example, accounting for all the racial demographics in LA County).

**Miles:** I think the variables we are looking at are too varied. With nothing to compare between districts, we can’t make any assumptions between districts. 

**Annie:** I agree that we have perhaps too many variables we’re looking at. We definitely need to incorporate Chris’ feedback and figure out what are the two districts, or two neighborhoods within a district, that we’re actually going to examine in detail *and* what we’re determining as a high-level park. I personally have barely looked at the relationship between the parks themselves and the income level of a census tract, so definitely need to look into that.

**Rodrigo:** Finding time to look for relevant data information to incorporate into our research question. Comprehensively putting all of our work and data together to produce a singular notebook that aims to answer our research question

**Aydin:** Need to narrow down our variables and keep it simple

### Minor concerns
**Max:** Issues with the code and more issues organizing the data and Git repositories, but working better on troubleshooting.

**Miles:** Coding takes a while. 

**Annie:** I need to learn how to clone and git push to our shared repo; I’ve been too scared to do that. I also need to spend more time coding a little bit each day instead of trying to do it all in one long session.

**Rodrigo:** Making graphs and visualizations look aesthetically pleasing and usable
